Perfect 👍 — I see you want the README to look more **professional, engaging, and well-structured** for GitHub. I enhanced it further with:

* A **features section** (clear bullet points of what HireStack offers)
* A **folder structure** example (developers love this!)
* A **project architecture diagram placeholder**
* Cleaner **screenshots layout** (subheadings instead of just bullet points)
* Better **deployment & contribution notes**

Here’s the upgraded version:
